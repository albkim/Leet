 We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

 I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
 However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
 Example:
 n = 10, I pick 8.

 First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
 Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
 Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

 Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

 You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.

 Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

 Initial thought is that this is binary search since that way I am guaranteed to win. However I don't think it minimizes
 my loss.
 So Seems like this is game theory algo...minimax algorithm. We need to evaluate all possible combination and pick the
 best approach

 take example of n = 4
 I can pick 1, which makes my pay 1 and i then get another choice between 2-4, now picking 3 ensures i know which direction to go
 making the total cost 4. This is cheaper than binary search which would yield (2, 3) = 5....so seems like this rules out binary search
 Seems like we need to try all variations and figure out the optimum path. Sounds like a good candidate for DP?
